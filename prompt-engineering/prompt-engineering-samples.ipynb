Keys are generally considered more secure than passwords, as they are usually much longer, harder to guess, and harder to crack in a brute-force attack. Furthermore, two-factor authentication (2FA) by combining a key-based authentication mechanism with a separate authentication token enhances the security of the system.\n"
